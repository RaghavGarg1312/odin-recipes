    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cream Crackers or Digestive Biscuits</li>
        <li>Honey or Melted Butter</li>
        <li>Ground Cinnamon </li>
        <li>Mangoes</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Agar Agar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the agar agar strands with kitchen scissors to small pieces. You should get about 5 to 6 tablespoons of finely chopped agar agar strands.</li>
        <li>Soak the agar agar pieces in ½ cup of water for 25 to 30 mins. Read on below if using agar agar powder.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, break 14 to 15 crackers or biscuits in a dry grinder, blender or food processor. Powder to a fine consistency. A slightly semi-fine consistency is also alright.</li>
        <li> Add ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon and 3 tablespoons honey or 3 tablespoons melted butter.</li>
        <li>Process till the honey or butter mixes well. Scrape with a spoon or spatula if required.</li>
        <li>Grease the base of a 8 inch detachable pie pan with softened butter. This is a tart pan with a detachable base, but a springform pan will also work. Skip this step if you are using individual bowls or glasses.

        </li>
        <li>Place the powdered cracker or biscuits on the greased pan base. Spread the layer evenly with a spoon or spatula and press in the crust with your fingertips. Place the crust in the fridge for about 15 minutes to set.</li>
        <li>Peel and chop 3 medium-sized mangoes. Prepare the mango purée in a blender. Divide the mango puree into two roughly equal portions in separate bowls and keep aside.</li>
        <li> Beat or whip 200 to 225 cream cheese, 200 ml light cream or whipping cream, ½ cup sugar and vanilla extract to a smooth even mixture.</li>
        <li>Add half of the mango puree to the whipped cream cheese mixture. Mix very well.</li>
        <li>Now heat the pan containing the agar agar and water to a simmer over a low heat. Keep on stirring and cook this mixture till the agar agar dissolves in the water and you see a smooth gelatinous liquid.</li>
        <li>Allow the agar agar solution to cool for about 2 minutes, then add half of it to the mango cream cheese mixture and stir quickly and vigorously.</li>
        <li>Add another half of the agar agar solution to the remaining half of the mango puree and stir quickly to make an even mixture. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>Pour the mango cream cheese mixture on the base cracker layer. Shake the pan gently to spread the cream cheese. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to even out the mango cream cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Place the pan in the fridge for about 20 to 25 minutes for the second layer to set a bit. Then, spread the remaining mango+agar agar mixture very gently on the cream cheese layer without disturbing it.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for 5 to 6 hours or overnight till the cheesecake is set.</li>
        <li>This is mango cheesecake set and done, the next day. Gently remove the base on a cake stand or on a serving plate. This one is just topped with some mint leaves for garnish.</li>
        <li> You can decorate the cheesecake with chopped mangoes, chocolate shavings, whipped cream, or anything that you and your family prefers.</li>
        <li>Slice the mango cheese cake and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
